Video streaming app powered by Google Drive and LibVLC.

#### Perks
- HEVC encoded video = lower bandwidth usage and higher quality videos
- One of the best CDN in world = No random buffering and up to 1 Gbps download speed (I've tested it with my internet)
- One of the most powerful video player (VLC) on the market = Play pretty much any video format available on Earth
- Free

#### Require: Authentication with a Google Drive Account 

Why?
- To use Google Drive API for downloading/streaming videos
- To take advantage of Google Drive overpowered CDN
- To bypass Google Drive file download limitation, the app will copy the file into the user's Google Drive account.
